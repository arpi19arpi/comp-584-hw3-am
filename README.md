The centering is achieved through these critical CSS rules:
css
body {
    display: flex; //Enables Flexbox layout model
    justify-content: center; // centers horizontally
    align-items: center; //centers vertically
    min-height: 100vh; // Ensures body takes at least full viewport height
    padding: 20px; //makes space around the body
}
.container {
    max-width: 600px; // Limits container width for better readability
    width: 100%; //Makes container responsive
    text-align: center; // centers text content
}


Responsive Image Handling
"width="100%" makes the image responsive
"style="max-width:560px;" prevents the image from exceeding its intrinsic width

Appropriate line height for readability
Consistent spacing between sections
Left-aligned body text for better reading experience
